## DARTS

**Darts Rules**

Below are the rules to some of the more popular dart games.

Equipments needed:

- Dartboard
- Set of three darts
- Place to play

**What is a Dartboard?**

A circular board marked with numbered segments, used as a target in the game of darts. The standard international dartboard is known as the "clock" board.  It is 18 inches in diameter and has 20 numbered, pie-shaped segments of equal size, plus the bull's-eye.

**CRICKET**

Number of Players: Two individual players or two teams.

Numbers in Play: 20,19,18,17,16,15, and bull's-eye.

The objective shall be to 'own'/'close' certain numbers on the board, and to achieve the highest point score. The player/team to do so first, shall be the winner.

Each player/team shall take turns throwing. (Three darts in succession shall constitute a 'turn'/'Inning'.)

To close an inning, the player/team must score three of a number. This can be accomplished with three singles, a single and a double, or a triple.

**'01 GAMES**

Number of Players: Any number of players may play, but normally two individuals or two teams play.

Numbers in Play: All the numbers are in play, but some receive greater use than others.  The 19 and 20, for instance are used extensively for scoring points since they are the highest numbers on the board.  All the numbers may be used to throw the necessary doubles in the game.

This game is generally played by two people but can be played by teams. Each player starts with 301 points. The goal for each player is to reach zero, excatly, by subtracting the amount they score in a turn from the amount they had left from the previous turn.

**BASEBALL**

Number of Players: Any number can play, but it is unusual to have only two players or two teams (like the game of baseball itself)

Numbers in Play: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 7, 8, 9

Rules of Play: This game is similar to the actual game of baseball. Players try to score as many points as possible per inning in order to win. The goal is to hit the number that corresponds to the current inning. For example, in the first inning players can only hit a 1 in order to score points. For any inning, a single is one run, a double is two runs, and a triple is three.

At the end of nine innings, the player with the most runs wins. If the players are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings can be played  with an equal number of turns per player (just like real baseball) until someone wins.  

**KILLER**

Number of Players: Any number can play, but Killer is most fun with three or more players.

Numbers in Play: The numbers used are determined by the players.  Each player throws one dart with the "opposite" hand.  (e.g., right-handers throw left-handed) to determine randomly his or her own number.  If a player misses the dartboard or hits a number already taken, he or she throws again.

Rules of the Game:  Each player first tries to hit the double of his or her own number.  When this is acheived, the player is known as a "killer" and a K is placed after his name on the scoreboard.  After becoming a killer, a player begins aiming for the doubles of opponents' numbers.  Each player has three lives and whenever a killer hits an opponents' double the opponent loses one of his lives.  If a killer hits his or her own double by mistake, the killer loses one live; it is therefore possible to kill yourself by accident. it is also possible to kill an opponent in one exceptional three dart turn by throwing three doubles.  The game progresses until only one person has any lives left.

**SHANGHAI**

Number of Players: Any number can play, it is sometimes played with a dozen or more players.

Numbers in Play: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Rules of Play:  Players take turns throwing at the numbers 1, 2, and so on, in sequence, until 7. They try to score as many points as possible per turn (using all three darts). Only darts hitting the number in play count for score. So, when the number 1 is in play, the highest score that can be achieved is three - if the player hits a 1 with each dart. However, when the number 7 is the number in play, the highest score could be a 21 - if the player hits 7 all three times. Obviously, as the game progresses, the score gets higher. There are two ways to win: either have the highest score at the end of the game or score a shanghai and win automatically. A shanghai is hitting the single, double and triple of the number in play. 

**LEGS**

Number of Players:  Any number can play

Numbers in Play: All the numbers on the board are used, but players generally concentrate on the 19 or 20. 

Rules of Play: After determining the order of the play, the first player attempts to get the highest score possible and notes it on the scoreboard.  The next player must exceed that score or "lose a leg".  Each player starts with three legs and players lose a leg every time they fail to beat the score of the player immediately preceeding them.  The winner is the last player left with any legs. 

**51 BY 5'S**

Number of Players: Any number can play

Numbers in Play: All the numbers on the dartboard are used, but the score of every three-dart turn must be divisible by 5, so the commonly aimed-for numbers are those divisible by five: 20, 15, 10, 5. 

Rules of Play:

The total points for each turn must be divisible by five to receive any score. The score for each turn is determined by the number of fives hit. For example, if a player gets 20 points on a turn, the score is 4 because 20 divided by 5 is 4. If a score for an entire turn is not divisible by 5, it is not counted. All numbers on the board are used, including triples, doubles and bulls. The winner is the first player to score fifty-one fives and all three darts must score on the last turn. 

**ROUND THE WORLD**

(Also called "Round the Board" or "Once Round the Island.")

Number of Players: Two players

Darts: Three each

Rules of Play:  The object of this popular game is to be the first player to hit every number on the dartboard from 1-20. Any part of the number - single, double or triple - counts. The numbers must be hit in order, and players alternate after three throws. If a player cannot pass a certain number, he must hit it in order to advance to the next number on the board. 

**ENGLISH CRICKET**

Number of Players: Two players or two teams

Numbers in Play:  All numbers are used but since each score must exceed 40 the higher numbers especially 20 are the favorites.

Rules of Play:  One player becomes the batter, and the other is the bowler; the batter goes first. Ten stripes are entered on the dartboard as wickets. The bowler's task is to erase these wickets by hitting bull's-eyes: With each single bull's-eye, one wicket is erased, and with each double bull's-eye, two wickets are erased. The batter's task is to score as many points or runs while any wickets remain, but only scores over 40 count. For example, a score of 38 would score no runs, a score of 42 would score 1 run and a score of 60 would score 20 and so on. 

Scoring stops when all 10 wickets are (or crossed out) by the bowler. The batter notes his or her final score on the scoreboard, and the roles are reversed. The game is played in two seperate rounds, with each player throwing an entire round as batter and bowler. The winner is the player with the most points, or runs, from his or her round as batter.
